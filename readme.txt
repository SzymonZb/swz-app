System wspomagania zarządzania (Management Support System) is an app created for making communication with other employees easier and more clear to each other. 
It is also my practice project, to which I want to add more functionalities over time.

Currently app gather information about work in progress from differrent users, created by admin in Django administration. Admin can view all new messages, sent by users,
in Django administration panel. "It ain't much, but it's honest work" :) I used Django, because of it's flexibility and dozens of already built-in tasks. 
Currently I plan to add module organising remote wrok.

App currently work like other apps built with Django, please remember to install requirements.txt. The current databse is set to sqlite3, but settings to PostgreSQL 
are already there, just uncomment it and comment sqlite lines.

I haven't added the admin interface yet, so currently it works with Django administration. I'm gonna change it in future to make it look more friendly with user.

While working on the project, I made use of the Denis Ivy Channel and also Kacper Sieradziński channel on youtube, and some of my own expirience from SDA 
"Python form scratch" course.
